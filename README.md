# tetris-rs 

a draft implemenation of tetris using rust, wasm and a html canvas.
most of the code is just a hack... enjoy ;-)

# how it works

basic idea is that the rust code acts as backend and javascript plus html as frontend. the backend sends strings as response to the frontend.

the main rust code is under the src folder. the www folder contains the html and javascript (and plumbing code required for wasm-bindgen). 

# how to deploy 

i used the output of `npx webpack` (as described https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/whirlwind-tour/basic-usage.html) and moved the generated code from www/dist to the docs folder so that it's also available via github pages

# play in your browser

just open https://kr-g.github.io/tetris-rs/

it's possible to play tetris in the browser on github pages, just open https://kr-g.github.io/tetris-rs/ 
use the keyboard or the html buttons on the page to control the blocks (might not work proper on mobile browsers due to screen size... sorry for that... but i only wanted to try wasm and dont wanted to build a full fledged game running on all devices... )
